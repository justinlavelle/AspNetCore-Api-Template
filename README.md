# Getting Started?

**Make sure you have .NET CORE SDK  installed & VS 2017 tooling **

### Visual Studio 2017

Make sure you have .NET Core 1.0+ [https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core] installed and/or VS2017.
VS2017 will automatically install all the neccessary .NET dependencies when you open the project.
Also, include this: [https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windowsvs2017]

Simply push F5 to start debugging !

### Visual Studio Code

> Note: Make sure you have the C# extension & .NET Core Debugger installed.

# Upcoming Features:

# Deployment

### Dotnet publish


# Application Structure:

> Note: This application has WebAPI (our API) setup inside the same solution, but of course all of this 
could be abstracted out into a completely separate project('s) ideally. 

**Root level files** 

Here we have the *usual suspects* found at the root level.

- `appsettings.json` - configuration file implemented through Options pattern
