# Features:

> These are just some of the features found in this starter!

- **ASP.NET Core 1.1**
  - Written in C#, VS2017 & SQL Database

- **Dependecy injection** :
  - Projects are structured to de-couple technology from the business logic
  - Configuration [appsettings.json] is integrated via "Options" Pattern with a configuration service

  - **Swagger**
  - Api Documentation
  - Easy Web Api Methods access for testing

  - **Logging** [Implementation available but not used]
  - Remote Logging
  - Using Gray Logging [replace serverUrl="http://graylog.xxxxx.co.za:12XXX/gelf" with appropriate address]

  - **Exception Handling Middleware**
  - No need for pesky Try...Catch blocks 
  - ... at least wrt catching system errors. Still need to use them for throwing application exceptions ;)

- **Testing frameworks** [Not Yet Implemented]

# Getting Started?

**Make sure you have .NET CORE SDK  installed & VS 2017 tooling **

### Visual Studio 2017

Make sure you have .NET Core 1.0+ [https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core] installed and/or VS2017.
Installing VS2017 will automatically install all the neccessary .NET dependencies when you open the project.
Also, include this: [https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windowsvs2017]

Simply push F5 to start debugging !

### Visual Studio Code

> Note: Make sure you have the C# extension & .NET Core Debugger installed.

# Upcoming Features:

-  ;) 

----

# Deployment

### Dotnet publish


# Application Structure:

> Note: This application has WebAPI (our API) setup inside the same solution, but of course all of this 
could be abstracted out into a completely separate project('s) ideally. 

**Root level files** 

Here we have the *usual suspects* found at the root level.

- `HC.Template`         - configuration file implemented through Options pattern
- `HC.Domain`           - configuration file implemented through Options pattern
- `HC.Infrastructure`   - configuration file implemented through Options pattern
- `HC.Interface`        - configuration file implemented through Options pattern
- `HC.WebAPI`           - configuration file implemented through Options pattern

- `appsettings.json`             - configuration file implemented through Options pattern. Replaces traditional App.config/Web.config
- `appsettings.Development.json` - configuration file implemented through Options pattern
- `appsettings.Production.json`  - configuration file implemented through Options pattern

- `nlog.config`         - configuration file necessary for implementing Nlog/Gray Logging

*** The service will use `appsettings.json` and one of 'Development' or 'Production' depending on the [env.EnvironmentName]
